Requirements:
Make a parking app.
There is a limited number of parking spaces available. They can be of 3 sizes - S, M and L.
Various types of vehicles enter the parking lot - motorcycles, cars and trucks. They are ranked as follows:
â–« S â€“ fits one motorcycle
â–« M - two motorcycles or one car
â–« L - 4 motorcycles, 2 cars or one truck
Parking must show the number of available spaces of all types.
When a vehicle enters, it needs to be told where to stand. The denser the parking lot, the better.
Each vehicle has its own rate. Also, the price depends on the parking time. For example, for a car:
ðŸ’² first 10 minutes are free
ðŸ’² next 50 minutes - 300 rubles
ðŸ’² 1-3 hours - 250 rubles per hour
ðŸ’² 3 hours and beyond - 200 rubles per hour
Payment is considered when the vehicle leaves the parking lot.
